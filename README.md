# A* Pathfinding Visualization

This Python program provides a graphical representation of the A* pathfinding algorithm on a grid. Users can interactively set the start and goal cells, place obstacles, and visualize the algorithm's progress in real-time.

## Features

- **Grid Dimensions:**
  - Before initiating the program, the user is prompted to input the dimensions of the grid, specifying the number of rows and columns in the GUI window itself.

- **Setting Start and Goal:**
  - Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) where the user can interactively set the start and goal cells by clicking on specific cells. Grid lines are also displayed.

- **Obstacle Placement:**
  - Functionality is provided in the GUI to allow users to click and place obstacles on the grid. Different colors represent Start, Goal, and Obstacle cells.

- **Visualization:**
  - Utilizes the Tkinter library for GUI to dynamically update the progress of the A* algorithm as it searches for the optimal path from the start to the goal, considering obstacles.

- **User-Friendly:**
  - The program is designed to be user-friendly and efficiently demonstrates the A* algorithm's functionality in real-time on the provided grid.
